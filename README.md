Very simple, work in progress input driver for the SPI keyboard / trackpad found on 12" MacBooks (2015 and later) and newer MacBook Pros (late 2016 and later), as well a simple touchbar driver for 2016 MacBook Pro's.

Using it:
---------
If you're on a MacBook8,1 (2015) you may need the `irqpoll` kernel parameter. To get this driver to work on all other MacBooks and MacBook Pros, you'll need to boot the kernel with `intremap=nosid` if you're running a kernel before 4.11. In all cases make sure you don't have `noapic` in your kernel options.

On the 2015 MacBook you need to (re)compile your kernel with `CONFIG_X86_INTEL_LPSS=n` if running a kernel before 4.14. On all kernels you need ensure the `spi_pxa2xx_platform` module is loaded (if you don't have that module, rebuild your kernel with `CONFIG_SPI_PXA2XX=m`).

On all other MacBook's and MacBook Pros you need to make sure both the `spi_pxa2xx_platform` and `intel_lpss_pci` modules are loaded (if these don't exist, you need to (re)compile your kernel with `CONFIG_SPI_PXA2XX=m` and `CONFIG_MFD_INTEL_LPSS_PCI=m`).

DKMS module (Debian & co):
--------------------------
As root, do the following:
```
apt install dkms
git clone https://github.com/cb22/macbook12-spi-driver.git /usr/src/applespi-0.1
dkms install -m applespi -v 0.1

echo -e "\n# applespi\napplespi\nintel_lpss_pci\nspi_pxa2xx_platform" >> /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
update-initramfs -u
```

What works:
-----------
* Basic Typing
* FN keys
* Driver unloading (no more hanging)
* Basic touchpad functionality (even right click, handled by libinput)
* MT touchpad functionality (two finger scroll, probably others)
* Interrupts!
* Suspend / resume

What doesn't work:
------------------
* Key rollover (properly)
* Wakeup on keypress / touchpad
 
Known bugs:
-----------
* Occasionally, the SPI device can get itself into a state where it causes an interrupt storm. There should be a way of resetting it, or better yet avoiding this state altogether.

Interrupts:
-----------
Interrupts are now working! This means that the driver is no longer polled, and should no longer be a massive battery drain. For more information on how the driver receives interrupts, see the discussion [here](https://github.com/cb22/macbook12-spi-driver/pull/1)

Touchpad:
---------
The touchpad protocol is the same as the bcm5974 driver. Perhaps there is a nice way of utilizing it? For now, bits of code have just been copy and pasted.

Debugging:
----------
The `debug` module parameter can be used to turn debugging output on (and off) dynamically, and can be set in all the usual ways (e.g. via kernel command-line (`applespi.debug=0x1`), via sysfs (`echo 0x10000 | sudo tee /sys/module/applespi/parameters/debug`), etc.).

Some useful values are (since the value is a bitmask, these can be combined):
* 0x10000 - determine touchpad values range
* 0x1     - turn on logging of touchpad initialization packets
* 0x6     - turn on logging of backlight and caps-lock-led packets

Touchbar:
---------
The touchbar driver is called `appletb`. It provides basic functionality, enabling the touchbar and switching between modes based on the FN key. Furthermore the touchbar is automatically switched off if no (internal) keyboard, touchpad, or touchbar input is received for 60 seconds; any (internal) keyboard or touchpad input switches it back on.
